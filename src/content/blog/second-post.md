Component Islands are one of Astro's most powerful features. They allow you to mix static and dynamic content in a way that optimizes performance.

## What are Islands?

Islands are interactive UI components in an otherwise static HTML page. They enable you to:

- Load JavaScript only where needed
- Improve initial page load times
- Maintain interactivity where required

## Benefits of Islands Architecture

1. Better performance
2. Reduced JavaScript overhead
3. Improved user experience
4. Flexible development approach
